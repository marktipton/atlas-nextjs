## Atlas Next JS

This is the starter template for the Atlas Next JS project. It contains the starting code for the Q&A application.

### What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static web applications. It provides an easy way to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly applications. Developed by Vercel, Next.js simplifies the development of React applications with features like routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation.

### Key Features
- **File-based Routing**: Automatically creates routes based on the file structure in the `pages` directory.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Pre-renders pages on each request, making them fast and SEO-friendly.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, providing a highly optimized static site.
- **API Routes**: Create backend API endpoints within the same project using file-based routing in the `pages/api` directory.
- **CSS and Sass Support**: Out-of-the-box support for global and component-level CSS, as well as Sass.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images with the `Image` component for better performance.
- **Typescript Support**: Includes built-in support for TypeScript with minimal configuration required.
- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback when editing React components for a smooth developer experience.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static content on-demand without rebuilding the entire site.
